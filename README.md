### About
This project is a fully functional implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, developed using modern web technologies. The game allows two players to alternate turns, marking their respective symbols ('X' or 'O') in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three consecutive marks, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the game.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive Design:** The game is built to function seamlessly on all screen sizes, ensuring an enjoyable experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI:** Utilizes **CSS** for a visually appealing interface, combined with **JavaScript** for dynamic gameplay interactions.
- **Winning Logic:** The game includes built-in logic to detect and declare a winner as soon as three marks are aligned, or to announce a draw when all spaces are filled without a winner.
- **Reset Option:** After each game, players can reset the board to start a new game without reloading the page.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** for structuring the game board and UI elements.
- **CSS3** for styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for game logic, interactions, and event handling.
- **Git** for version control and project management.
